# Tutorial Style and Guidelines

## Data extraction

Prefer storing extracted data in csv files over other formats, but only where sensible (for example extraction of geographic coordinates can use geojson)
Pandas can be used for python data extraction and cleaning
You can create a virtual environment for python and install pandas for execution and verification

## Diificulty and Progression

Tutorials should walk students through the steps required to complete the activity by providing prompts they can follow. However, students should not always be provided with the full answers - we sometimes want them to think critically and use their own initiative to figure out answers. In general, the tutorials in the first weeks should be easier than the tutorials in later weeks - we can provide more direct instruction and scaffolding in the early weeks, and gradually become slightly vaguer as the weeks go on.

For example, in a coding activity we could provide them with a full code snippet to insert into a code file at a particular point, or we could provide them with an instruction to complete a particular section of a code file and give them some hints as to how to do this.

**Updates:**
- Providing larger, complete code snippets is preferred to support students.
- Boilerplate code and "glue" code should be provided where possible.
- Explain *how* and *why* specific lines of code work.
- Use **Pandas** for Python data extraction tasks.
- Use **GeoJSON** for map data.

For a spreadsheet example, we could give the students the full formula required to do some data extraction or cleaning, or we could ask them in more general terms to use a formula to complete a particular task.

For an example using a desktop or online tool, we could tell students exactly which buttons to press or which parts of the software to use, or we could be more general and point them in a general direction with some hints on how to accomplish the task.

## Language

Language should be plain, clear and simple at all times. We should avoid jargon where possible.

We should explain why we are doing things as well as telling the students what they need to do in order to complete a task. 

## Data Visualisation Theory

Where possible, we should try to link decisions made in the presenting data to data visualisation principles and theory. However, we should not do this too often, the focus for these exercises is practical implementation of theory, not revision of theory alone. 

# Images and Screenshots

Where possible include screenshots of progress within the tutorial. Where screenshots are not possible for you to take automatically, leave a comment in the tutorial so that a screenshot can be added manually later
