## Code style

We should prefer clarity over complexity, this code is to be used for student learning and sometimes verbosity is better if it makes the code easier to understand


## Commenting

Comment why not what - code should be clear enough to be self commenting
Remove redundant comments, speculation on functions, or reminders to implement things later
